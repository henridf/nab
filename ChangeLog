release 0.7
-----------
        New Features:
	
	- Rewritten AODV implementation, now fully compliant with RFC 3561.
	
	- Completely revamped the for MAC implementations to allow
	implementing more complex and realistic MACs.
	Backend (control logic, buffering, retransmissions) and frontend
	(radio, contention) can now be implemented separately, and
	different backends can be mixed and matched as long as they
	respect the class types defined in sim/interfaces/mac.mli.
	It is still possible to implement MACs as previously, ie by
	implementing front and backend in the same class.

	- Physical propagation model using log-normal shadowing

	- Modelling of two common sensor network radio chips (Xemics
	XE1205 and ChipCon CC1000).

        - Persistency: Support for saving/restoring nearly all state of a
	simulation (Parameters, mobility objects, routing agents, etc).


	
	
	Detailed changes:
	
	- Removed GPSnodes, having a separate class for this (along with
	separate functions in nodes.ml) was overkill. 
	
	- Use odoc_fhtml (by M. Guesdon) to generate javadoc-like html
	documentation (ie, with frames).
	
	- Added support in the protocol stack architecture for (optional)
	MAC-layer callbacks to notify the upper layer when a packet could
	not be transmitted.
	
	- Added support in routing agent base classes for maintaining and
	exporting stats, similar to MAC layer base classes.
	
	- Changed type of destination field in l2 packet so that broadcast
	is represented as a 'special' int (similarly to l3 packet)
	
	- Simplification in rt_agent methods:
	  + #mac_recv_l3pkt now passes the l2src and l2dst parameters as
	    well as the l3pkt, also renamed to #recv_pkt_mac
	  + #mac_recv_l2pkt removed (not needed now)
	  + Rt_agent#app_recv_l4pkt renamed to #recv_pkt_app, 
	
	- Removed #cheat_send_pkt from simplenode and rt_agent_base APIs.
	One should simply install a cheat_mac if needed, and use the same
	old mac_send_pkt as in the regular case.
	
	- Changed l2pkt type to allow MAC-layer specific extensions.

	
	Bugfixes:
	- Fixed bug in billiard mobility model reported by h. vimadamal
