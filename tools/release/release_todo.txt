- if we keep ounit, add README and LICENSE files to contrib dir.
- document new *mli files in scripts (warmup_utils, ..)
- update tutorial


- why are there any bw links at all with null mac???
- check if srcdir can be same variable in both scripts
- make smoke-tutorial more smart - some lessons can be rnu in scripted, some
  can't (cos they would remain stuck in gui)
- if smoke-tut running from /home/henridf/work/nab, should not do the sed on
  ocamlinit, etc.
