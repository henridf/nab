NAB - AODV Implementation (RFC 3561 compliant)


Some notes on gray areas in the RFC and how they are dealt with in the NAB
AODV implementation.



- Incrementing destination sequence number on a route break.
According to RFC 6.11 (i), when a next hop breaks, you increment the sequence
number only at the time when you originate the RERR, which comes after having
attempted a local repair (if that was turned on).
But (when doing local repair) it is necessary to increment the dest. sequence
no *before* sending out the first RREQ.
