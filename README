** COMPILING
**

To compile mws only:

	make bin/mws

To compile mws with gui libraries:

	make bin/gui

To compile as native code (runs faster), pass OPT=y flag to make, as in

	make OPT=y bin/gui 

Usually, one compiles mws with a script file:

	make SCRIPT=filename bin/mws

where filename is assumed to be a file in the scripts/ directory, as in

	make SCRIPT=demo.ml bin/gui
	or
	make OPT=y SCRIPT=demo.ml bin/gui
	or
	make SCRIPT=grep.ml bin/mws

**
** OTHER TARGETS
**

To build documentation: 

	make htmldoc

This will create a set of html pages in the doc/ subdir, that you can 
browse starting from doc/index.html
