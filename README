		   MWS - MULTIHOP WIRELESS SIMULATOR

		http://lcavwww.epfl.ch/~henridf/mws.html



To compile mws only:

make bin/mws

To compile mws with gui libraries:

make bin/gui

To compile as native code (runs faster):

make OPT=y bin/gui 
(or
 make OPT=y bin/mws)


Usually, one compiles mws with a script file:

make SCRIPT=filename bin/mws

where filename is assumed to be a file in the scripts/ directory, as in

make SCRIPT=demo.ml bin/gui
or
make OPT=y SCRIPT=demo.ml bin/gui
or
make SCRIPT=grep.ml bin/gui
