-  mob.ml is tied in an ugly manner to pixels, epflcoords, etc, which obliges
    things like:
    + have epflcoords and readcoords in mws_object_files in makefile
    + replicate pix/mtr conversion functions in mob.ml

    need to break this somehow.
    this will also allow putting the params.x/y_pix_size into mwsconv.ml,
    where they belong

- install ocaml-unused-var-warning.patch  (when moved to 3.07)
- maybe have ways to customize logging (precision of time in left column), do
   we write log_level or not, etc)
- mhooks : when you replace an array of agents with new ones, the old ones
  don't go away because they are still hooked in to their owners...
  one possibility would be to have add_*_hook methods return a handle (for
  example hooks are kept in a hash), and then a diff_Agent (or anyone else who
  has a handle) can have a detach() method which kills all its hooks before
  dying. 
  
- config: 
  val make_cmdline_able : 'a t -> unit
  val make_not_cmdline_able : 'a t -> unit

- creating nodes in script_utils
  there are going to be an increasing # of possible configurations, ie all 
  possible combinations of agents, MACs, etc.
  So instead of having one explicit function for each one (make_grease_nodes,
  make_grep_nodes, etc), we should have a more generic way of doing it.

  One possible solution:maybe a make_nodes(), then a make_*_agent which makes * type agents and adds
  them, similarly for macs, etc. Then we have a # of make funs which is linear
  in the # of different agents/macs/nodes rather than the comb. explosion of
  all combinations.

  Another possible solution: all these choosable things (which MAC, which
  diffusion algo, which routing agent) are settable by Params. Then there is
  only one "make_macs" which makes them based on what the Param value is.
  
- get rid of gpsnodes  
- the hooking scheme for movenode and gps nodes is a bit weird. maybe should
  forget about gpsnode subclass, and simply do an aggregation relationship,
  having simplenode aggregate a 'gpsreceiver' object. 

- a big question is coming back all the time about how/where to access
  objects. For example, i make many hello_agents. Are these kept in an array
  in the same file as the hello_Agent class? in the script file? this impacts
  then routings like proportion_met_nodes(), etc..

- time printing in sched should use log. but this made a headache for circular
  dependency...

- neighbors: right now, seems like a node has itself as a neighbor. is this
  necessary? seems not. check well before changing...

- clean up mobility :
  granularity needs to be solidified. IF it is going to be used, then shoudl
  be tweakable. Also how does it relate to say random walk processes. Do they
  simply ignore it? Or do we distinguish between 'continuous' and 'discrete'
  classes?

  
- think about order in which mhooks is invoked. it can matter, in the case
  where agent code modifies packet. f. ex in ease_agent, if anchor changes in
  last hop, then we get:
  hop:<2865.353, 2561.326> 	anchor:<2970.990, 2469.370> 	age:8.000000 	cost:0.000000
  hop:<2918.412, 2582.598> 	anchor:<2970.990, 2469.370> 	age:8.000000 	cost:0.000000
  hop:<2989.889, 2587.548> 	anchor:<2970.990, 2469.370> 	age:8.000000 	cost:0.000000
  hop:<2949.183, 2459.140> 	anchor:<2951.178, 2434.621> 	age:0.000000 	cost:24.599721
  hop:<2951.178, 2434.621> 	anchor:<2951.178, 2434.621> 	age:0.000000 	cost:24.599721
  Fatal error: exception Failure("Searchcost was non-zero without anchor change")

- packets: better, but still somewhat unhappy with the type.
  maybe the union of all possible packet types forms a tree, and packet is a
  path through that tree (ie, a list of headers)?? might be better for typing.
  might make all these recursive operations (like *_clone, *_size) easier

  wishlist: 
  expressive typing:
  each packet type is fully 'expressed' in the type system, meaning that it
  has its fields and only its own. For example, a grep l3hdr should not be the
  same as an ease l3hdr
  'automatic' cloning and sizing : ideally clone and size operations could be
  recursively done on each packet type.

  get rid of mutable fields? or if we keep them, have a failsafe way to control
  cloning etc?

- make redoes everythgin when OPT

- generic radio ranges. right now this is hard-coded. 
  what if nodes could vary their xmit power? what if we have diffent mac
  layers coexisting (say bluetooth and 802.11)?
  this will probably need quite some rethinking, because the whole notion of
  neighbors (as implemented in crworld for example) might need to change.

- ability to cancel events in scheduler. for example this would be useful in
  the case of mob objects: they should keep the handle around, so they can
  cancel it when stop() is called.
  status: not done, because solution for heap would be ugly (keep a separate
  list around of all events to be canceled, then check when running each
  handler if it is in canceled list).
  There might be some data structure which is better than a heap for this.
