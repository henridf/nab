<td colspan=3> AODV routes in a 2000 node network.<br>
Destination is in upper left corner.<br>
<p>
The darker line represents the effective route taken by a packet. 
<br>The red
lines represent a route request (RREQ) flood necessary to route the
packet. Expanding ring search is used.<br>
In
the first case, the route request is answered by an intermediate node quite close
to the source, hence the flood is local around the source.<br>
In the second case, the packet advances along a pre-existing route until it
hits a broken link in the middle; a local repair is performed at that point.
