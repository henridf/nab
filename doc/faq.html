<h2><a name="0">Why another network simulator?</a></h2>

<code>Nab</Code> was born out of its authors' inability to simulate large (as
in 10000s of nodes) ad hoc networks with existing tools, and impatience in dealing with
their internal complexity, which tended to make implementing new functionality a lengthy
and bug-ridden task.

<h2><a name="1">Why write it in ocaml?</a></h2>

Ocaml is a high-level, yet highly efficient programming language. It supports
both object-oriented and functional programming styles. Ocaml has a number of
attributes which make it very well-suited to writing a network simulator: 
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.bagley.org/~doug/shootout/craps.shtml">Speed, speed, speed.</a>.
<li>An interactive toplevel, offering the advantages typically associated with
a scripting language (interactively develop scripts, examine simulator
state). This makes things <b>much</b> simpler than integrating a scripting
language into a non-scripted language (say c++ and otcl), since everything
remains in one language domain, with no bindings to write, type conversions, etc.
<li>A replay debugger.
<li>Support for high-level, structured data types. For example a data type representing
an AODV route discovery (sequence of hops + possible route repair
floods) can be defined in a few lines.
</ul>

<h2><a name="2">What are the long-term plans for NAB?</a></h2>
Long-term plans often don't survive the short term, so we'll avoid answering
that one (but yes, we do have a few ideas..).

<h2><a name="3">What are the short-term plans for NAB?</a></h2>
In the very near future (ie, early May) we will release an update with a
802.11b-like MAC layer implemented, some propagation models, and a completed
implementation of a torus topology.
