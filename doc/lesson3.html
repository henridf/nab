<h1>Lesson 3: Simulating and visualizing FRESH and EASE</h1>
<p>
In this lesson, we will see how to set up the FRESH, EASE and GREASE protocols
(refs <a href="#bib">below</a>),
compute routes, and visualize them with nabviz. The instructions below show how to do this
step-by-step with the interactive <code>nab</code> toplevel. It is also a good
idea to look at the script file <a href="lesson3.ml">lesson3.ml</a> which
shows how one might write this up in a script.<br>
<font  size="-1">Note: This tutorial is packaged with the <code>nab</code> distribution, and
also available <a href="http://nab.epfl.ch">here</a>. If you are browsing the
tutorial files which came in the <code>nab</code> tarball, it might be a good
idea to check if a more recent version is available online. This file has

<h2><a name="0">0. Prerequisites</a></h2>

This lesson requires the following:
<ul>
<li> You have installed lablgtk 1.2 (see <a
href="../README">README</a> from the <code>NAB</code> distribution)
<li> You have built the <code>nabviz-top</code> interactive toplevel (see <a
href="../README">README</a>). The difference between
<code>nabviz-top</code> and the <code>nab-top</code> used in lessons 1 and 2 is
that <code>nabviz-top</code> links in the gtk libraries.
<li> You have gone through lessons 1 and 2 in the tutorial. 
</ul>

      
<h2><a name="1">1. Simulation setup</a></h2>

As always, we start off by launching the <code>nab</code> toplevel - except
that this time we invoke nabviz-top rather than nab-top, since we will be
needing the visualization libraries.
<pre class=example>
[henridf@lilblue: ~/work/nab] bin/nabviz-top 

     Network in a Box (nab) version 0.6pre
        Objective Caml version 3.07+2

# 
</pre>

We first configure the usual parameters and create the world object. This has
already been done in lessons 1 and 2 and is explained in more detail there.

<pre class=example>
# open Params;;
# let n = 1000 and range = 12.0 and avg_degree = 10;;
val n : int = 1000
val range : float = 12.
val avg_degree : int = 10
# Param.set nodes n;;
- : unit = ()
# Param.set radiorange range;;
- : unit = ()
# let x, y = Script_utils.size ~rrange:range  ~nodes:(Param.get nodes) ~avg_degree ();; 
  val x : float = 212.640541760032193
  val y : float = 212.640541760032193
# Param.set x_size x; Param.set y_size y;;
- : unit = ()
# Param.set World.world (World.Greedy, World.Two);
- : unit = ()
# Script_utils.init_world();;
0.000000 /global World: 212.64 x 212.64 [m],  12.00 radio range [m], 1000 nodes
- : unit = ()
# Param.set Params.mac "cheatmac";
- : unit = ()
</pre>

Now we create the nodes. We use the <code>make_naked_nodes</code> (which
creates nodes having neither MAC layer nor routing agent) function rather
than the <code>make_nodes</code> because we will manually configure them
afterwards. <br>

<pre class=example>
# Script_utils.make_naked_nodes ();;
- : unit = ()
</pre>

<p>
We will use 3 parallel stacks in this simulation, which will run GREASE, EASE,
and FRESH respectively (see lesson 2 for more information on parallel
stacks). 
<p>

To start off let's install a mac layer on each node, on all three
stacks. Installing a mac layer on a particular stack is as simple as in
installing a mac layer in lessons 1 and 2, with the added <code>~stack</code>
parameter that we must pass to <code>Script_utils.install_macs</code>.

<pre class=example>
# let nstacks = 3;;
val nstacks : int = 3
# for stack = 0 to nstacks - 1 do Script_utils.install_macs ~stack () done;;
- : unit = ()
</pre>

Now we are going to install the GREASE, EASE, and FRESH routing agents. These
protocols can be configured with the number of possible destinations to route
to. The possible destinations are chosen starting from node 0, so if we set n
targets, we can route to destinations 0..n-1.
 Selecting a smaller number of destinations allows the simulation to warmup (see
below) faster. 

<pre class=example>
# Param.set Ler_agent.ntargets 1;;
- : unit = ()
# Script_utils.install_ler_agents ~stack:0 Ler_agent.GREASE;;
- : unit = ()
# Script_utils.install_ler_agents ~stack:1 Ler_agent.EASE;;
- : unit = ()
# Script_utils.install_ler_agents ~stack:2 Ler_agent.FRESH;;
- : unit = ()
</pre>

<h2><a name="2">2. Making nodes move.</a></h2>
In simple terms, the defining characteristic of EASE and FRESH is that they
take advantage of node mobility. More specifically, the EASE protocol on a node
remembers <i>when and where</i> it has encountered other nodes; FRESH
remembers only <i>when</i> it has met other nodes. Therefore we will make
nodes move around until we have reached a given <i>encounter ratio</i>
(proportion of source-destination pairs which have been one-hop neighbors at
least once since the simulation started).<p>

We will create <i>billiard</i> mobility processes: nodes pick a uniform random
direction, and advance in that direction for a random interval T
(exponentially distributed) after which a new direction is chosen. Boundaries
are reflecting, ie a node bounces off as off of a mirror. We create the
processes by calling <code>Mob_ctl.make_billiard_mobs()</code>. Note that this
function takes an optional <i>granularity</i> parameter. The
<i>granularity</i> governs the step size
at which nodes move. There is a tradeoff between granularity and efficiency:
at one extreme, if we set a tiny granularity, the mobility processes will be
close to continuous, but this will load the scheduler with large numbers of
'node movement' events. <p>

When the mobility processes are created, they are initially in 'stopped'
state. We start them with the call to <code>start_all</code>. Note that after
this call, their <code>state</code> is 'moving' - but nothing will happen
until we start the scheduler event loop.

<pre class=example>
# Mob_ctl.make_billiard_mobs ~gran:(range /. 2.) ();;
- : unit = ()
# Mob_ctl.start_all();;
- : unit = ()
</pre>

In the following lines, we write a simple loop that makes nodes move for 60
(simulated) seconds, checks if we have reached the desired encounter ratio,
and repeats if not.

<pre class=example>
# let enc_ratio = 0.5;;
  val enc_ratio : float = 0.5
# let finished = ref false;;
- : val finished : bool ref = {contents = false}
# while (not !finished) do                               <!--test_keep-->
      (Sched.s())#run_for ~duration:30.0;                   <!--test_keep-->
      let p = Ler_utils.proportion_met_nodes() in          <!--test_keep-->
      Log.log#log_always (lazy (Printf.sprintf "Warming up: encounter ratio %f" p));<!--test_keep-->
      if  (p > enc_ratio) then   finished := true;          <!--test_keep-->
  done;;                                                  <!--test_keep-->

<h2><a name="3">3. Computing a few routes and statistics.</a></h2>
Before moving to the route visualization proper, we will see how one might go
about computing some routes, and a few statistics on these routes. To initiate
a route computation, we must inject an application packet at a node, as we
have done in previous lessons. For example to route a packet from source node
123 to destination node 0, we would do:

<pre class=example>
# Log.set_log_level Log.LOG_INFO;;
- : unit = ()
# (Nodes.node 123)#originate_app_pkt ~l4pkt:`EMPTY ~dst:0;;
183.000315 /node/123/grease_agent/0 received pkt with src 123, dst 0, enc_age 17976931348 ... 99881250404026184124858368.000000, anchor_pos <121.272, 45.552>

</pre>

One point to note that if you have followed this lesson verbatim, and have set ntargets to
1, the only possible destination is node 0 - you can try with another
destination but will get an exception, since routing tables only have 
entries to <code>Ler_agent.ntargets</code> nodes.  <p>

Now, once we have routed the packet using the two commands above, we see some
output (of course we could get even more by setting loglevel to DEBUG, or less
by leaving it at NOTICE). This type of output can be very useful to figure out
what sort of protocol interactions are going on, but of course is not the
ideal output to compute statistics for plots etc. So we are going to use hooks
once again, in order to keep track of the statistics we are interested in.
<br>
In this case, let's say we're interested in the <i>search cost</i> required to
establish a route. The search cost is the cumulative cost of successive anchor
searches in a route discovery; and we approximate it by the square of the
search disk radii (for more details see the <a href="#bib">publications</a>
cited below). 
<p>
We now are going to define and insert the hooks to measure search costs
(remember, a hook is simply a function which takes as
parameter a packet and a node, and which is invoked whenever a packet leaves
(or arrives at, depending on where the hook is inserted) a node).<br>
For this we do three things: First define three variables <code>grease_cost, ease_cost, and
fresh_cost</code> to store the cumulative search cost of the routes. Second we
define the hook function (<code>route_cost_hook</code>) itself. Third we add
the hooks to each stack. Notice that in the calls to add_pktout_mhook we 
partially apply the hook function to its cost argument (for example 
<code>(route_cost_hook grease_cost)</code>). 

<pre class=example>
# let grease_cost = ref 0.0 and ease_cost = ref 0.0 and fresh_cost = ref 0.0;;
val grease_cost : float ref = {contents = 0.}
val ease_cost : float ref = {contents = 0.}
val fresh_cost : float ref = {contents = 0.}

# let route_cost_hook tot_cost l2pkt node =      <!--test_keep-->
  let l3pkt = L2pkt.l3pkt l2pkt in               <!--test_keep-->
  let ler_hdr =  L3pkt.ler_hdr l3pkt in        <!--test_keep-->
  tot_cost := !tot_cost +. ((Ler_pkt.search_dist ler_hdr) ** 2.0);;
val route_cost_hook : float ref -> L2pkt.t -> 'a -> unit =  &lt;fun&gt;

# Nodes.iter (fun n -> n#add_pktout_mhook ~stack:0 (route_cost_hook grease_cost));;
- : unit = ()
# Nodes.iter (fun n -> n#add_pktout_mhook ~stack:1 (route_cost_hook ease_cost));;
- : unit = ()
# Nodes.iter (fun n -> n#add_pktout_mhook ~stack:2 (route_cost_hook fresh_cost));;
</pre>

The last three lines above might seem unusual to users
who are new to functional languages. They make use of a very powerful feature: the
ability to partially apply functions, and pass them around as first-class
citizens of the language. In this case we use the
<code>route_cost_hook</code> function defined above, which takes as first
argument a reference to the cost variable to be updated. Since we want to
update a different cost variable for each protocol, we construct a partially
applied function by applying <code>route_cost_hook</code> to the cost
variable. Note that without higher-order functions, we would have to
explicitly define one function for every hook! 

<pre class=example>
# let src = (World.w())#find_closest ~pos:(Nodes.node 0)#pos ~f:(fun nid -> (World.w())#dist_nodeids 0 nid > 100.) ();;
- : Common.nodeid_t option = Some 632
<!-- 
assert (((World.w())#dist_nodeids 0 632) > 100.);; <!--test_keep-->
 -->
# (Nodes.node 632)#originate_app_pkt ~l4pkt:`EMPTY ~dst:0;;
1023.000000 /node/632/grease_agent/0 received pkt with src 632, dst 0, enc_age 17976931348 ... 99881250404026184124858368.000000, anchor_pos <100.075, 158.195>

Now the routes have been computed, you can examine the cost variables, for example:
<pre class=example>
# !ease_cost;;
- : float = 433.088817056665334
</pre>

Of course measuring performance on a single route is not representative - as
an exercise one could write a little script which would compute routes from
every possible source to the destination, and compare the average cost.

<h2><a name="4">4. Visualizing the routes.</a></h2>
OK, we've spent enough time typing commands into the toplevel now!! Let's
launch the GUI. This is done by simply typing the three commands below.
The first two commands initialize nab's general gui code and the LER-specific
functions respectively. Once this is done we are ready to go; the call to
<code>Main.main </code> enters the GTK event loop. <br>
Have fun!!!

<pre class=example>
# Gui_gtk.init();;
- : unit -> unit =  &lt;fun&gt;
# Gui_ler.setup_easeviz_app();; 
- : unit = ()
# Main.main();;<!--test_ignore-->
