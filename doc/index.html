<code><b>Fake</b></code> is a network simulator written in Objective Caml (ocaml), a dialect of the
ML family. It is mostly geared toward simulation of multihop (wireless)
networks, though there is nothing that would prevent using <code>fake</code> to simulate
arbitrary (non-wireless) networks.

<code>Fake</Code> will be released sometime during April 2004; this documentation is
therefore in flux (and growing). Check back for updates!<br>

And if you would like to be notified when <code>fake</code> is released, please send mail to <IMG src="http://lcavwww.epfl.ch/~henridf/email.jpg">

We recommend having at least basic familiarity with ocaml (or another
ML-derived language) prior to starting out in <code>fake</code>. There are many great
resources 
(<a href="http://caml.inria.fr/books-eng.html">Books</a> and <a
href="http://caml.inria.fr/tutorials-eng.html">Tutorials</a>)
available to learn ocaml; two excellent ones in
particular are:

<ul>
<li> The 'Oreilly book' (online in <a
href="http://caml.inria.fr/oreilly-book/">English</a> or in <a
href="http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/Livres/ora/DA-OCAML/index.html">French</a>) is
an well-written and well-structured book, with both introductory and advanced
material. (a good read through chapters 2, 3, and 4 should be sufficient to
get started in <code>fake</code>). 

<li> Of the many online tutorials, the one by R. Jones is quite nice and
teaches ocaml by comparing and contrasting it with c and java. This one is
slightly less 'principled' than the O'Reilly book - take a look at both and
see what feels most comfortable!
</ul>

To compile and run <code>fake</code>, you must have ocaml installed. If you want gui
visualization, you will also need lablgtk. See the the <a
href="../README">README</a> from <code>fake</code> distribution.

<b>Interactive versus batch</b><br>

<code>Fake</Code> can be used either in interactive or in scripted mode. In interactive
mode, the user enters commands at the ocaml prompt to tell <code>fake</code> what to do.
In batch mode, a binary is compiled with all the simulation script included;
the simulation then runs unattended. 

Each mode has its own advantages: the interactive mode is useful to test
script commands without a cumbersome edit/compile/debug cycle; the batch mode
runs significantly faster (because binaries can be compiled to native code
for a roughly 3-10x speedup compared to interactive bytecode).

Note that since the exact same commands can be run in interactive and batch
mode, a common development model is to experiment with scripts interactively, 
and then use these scripts for long-running, performance-intensive simulations
in batch mode.

start and setup the <code>fake</code> toplevel, configure basic simulator parameters, and
run a simple flooding protocol over a network of static nodes.<br>

the flood tree afterward.<br>
