<p>
Mws is written in Objective Caml (ocaml), a dialect of the ML family.

We recommend having at least basic familiarity with ocaml (or another
ML-derived language) prior to starting out in mws. There are many great
resources 
(<a href="http://caml.inria.fr/books-eng.html">Books</a> and <a
href="http://caml.inria.fr/tutorials-eng.html">Tutorials</a>)
available to learn ocaml; two excellent ones in
particular are:

<ul>
<li> The 'Oreilly book' (online in <a
href="http://caml.inria.fr/oreilly-book/">English</a> or in <a
href="http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/Livres/ora/DA-OCAML/index.html">French</a>) is
an well-written and well-structured book, with both introductory and advanced
material. (a good read through chapters 2, 3, and 4 should be sufficient to
get started in mws). 

<li> Of the many online tutorials, the one by R. Jones is quite nice and
teaches ocaml by comparing and contrasting it with c and java. This one is
slightly less 'principled' than the O'Reilly book - take a look at both and
see what feels most comfortable!
</ul>

To compile and run mws, you must have ocaml installed. If you want gui
visualization, you will also need lablgtk. See the <a
href="../README">README</a> from mws distribution.

<b>Interactive versus batch</b><br>

Mws can be used either in interactive or in scripted mode. In interactive
mode, the user enters commands at the ocaml prompt to tell mws what to do.
In batch mode, a binary is compiled with all the simulation script included;
the simulation then runs unattended. 

Each mode has its own advantages: the interactive mode is useful to test
script commands without a cumbersome edit/compile/debug cycle; the batch mode
runs significantly faster (because binaries can be compiled to native code
for a roughly 3-10x speedup compared to interactive bytecode).

Note that since the exact same commands can be run in interactive and batch
mode, a common development model is to experiment with scripts interactively, 
and then use these scripts for long-running, performance-intensive simulations
in batch mode.

<a href="lesson1.html">Lesson 1</a>: In this first lesson, we will see how to
start and setup the mws toplevel, configure basic simulator parameters, and
run a simple flooding protocol over a network of static nodes.<br>
Lesson 2: More interesting flooding, with a CSMA mac layer, and reconstructing
the flood tree afterward.<br>
Lesson 3: Visualize LER routes with the GUI.<br>
