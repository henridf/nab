<h1> Overview of NAB Internals and APIs</h1>
<p>

The purpose of this page is to give a overview of NAB internals, and pointers
to the relevant APIs that are used when developping additional NAB modules,
such as a MAC layer, routing protocol, or visualization application. 
The NAB source code is extensively commented, and html documentation can be
generated using the ocamldoc tool (see <a
href="../README">README</a> for instructions on building the html documentation). 
<br><font size="-1">Note: This document is packaged with the <code>nab</code>
distribution, and is also available <a href="http://nab.epfl.ch">here</a>. If you
are browsing the version files which came in the <code>nab</code> tarball, it
might be a good idea to check if a more recent version is available
online. This file has revision $Revision$.</font>

<h2><a name="0">0. Interactive versus batch modes of operation</a></h2>

<code>Nab</Code> can be used either in interactive or in scripted mode. In interactive
mode, the user enters commands at the ocaml prompt to tell <code>nab</code> what to do.
In batch mode, a binary is compiled with all the simulation script included;
the simulation then runs unattended. 

Each mode has its own advantages: the interactive mode is useful to test
commands and scripts without a cumbersome edit/compile/debug cycle; the batch mode
runs significantly faster (because binaries can be compiled to native code
for a roughly 3-10x speedup compared to interactive bytecode).

Note that since the exact same commands can be run in interactive and batch
mode, a common development model is to experiment with scripts interactively, 
and then use these scripts for long-running, performance-intensive simulations
in batch mode.

<h2><a name="1">1. Scheduling discrete events</a></h2>

A discrete event scheduler lies at the heart of NAB. 
Basic functions (doc <a href="gen/Scheduler.t.html">here</a>) are to schedule an event at an absolute or relative time from
the present time, schedule a <code>stop</code> event, and cancel already scheduled
events. 
Two scheduler implementations are provided. The first is list-based
(doc <a href="gen/Sched.schedList.html">here</a>), and the second is heap-based 
(doc <a href="gen/Sched.schedHeap.html">here</a>). The heap-based scheduler is more efficient and is recommended.

<p>

<h2><a name="2">2. A global view of the world</a></h2>

A key object in NAB is the <code>world</code> object (doc <a href="gen/Worldt.html">here</a>), which
maintains a global view of network state, in particular node positions and
neighborhoods. <p>

When running a simulation one can choose between a lazy
(doc <a href="gen/Worldt.lazy_world_t.html">here</a>) and a greedy (doc <a href="gen/Worldt.greedy_world_t.html">here</a>). <br>
The greedy world recomputes a node's neighborhood each time that node moves,
whereas the lazy world only computes that neighborhood when it is required by
some part of NAB. <br>The lazy approach is usually more efficient. In particular,
if nodes are moving a lot, but few packets are being transmitted, then
the greedy approach of continually recomputing all neighborhoods can have
needlessly high overhead. Both approaches offer the same functionality, except
that the greedy world allows to register a callback function to be invoked
each time a node's neighborhood changes.

<p>

<h2><a name="3">3. Node objects, stacks, and hooks.</a></h2>

The node object is encapsulates most of the state and constituent objects
(routing agent, mac layer, traffic source) that are in a node. The basic node
class is the <code>simplenode</code> (doc <a href="gen/Simplenode.simplenode.html">here</a>); one can also
use the <code>gpsnode</code> (doc <a href="gen/Gpsnode.gpsnode.html">here</a>) which is is position-aware.
<p>
Each node has a unique identifier of type <code>Common.nodeid_t</code> (doc <a href="gen/Common.html">here</a>).
The <code>Nodes</code> module maintains a reference to all nodes, and offers
various node iterators and accessors.
<p>
Stacks are identified by an <code>int</code> (stack 0, stack 1, etc). In all
functions and methods which take a stack parameter, this parameter is optional
and defaults to 0. Therefore a one need never explicitly pass
<code>stack</code> parameters in a simulation which only uses one stack.
<p>
Nodes also offer hooks for which are used to insert a function which is then
called at specific events, ie when a packet enters or leaves a node. Hooks are
a very flexible and general mechanism to extract packet-level information as a
simulation runs; we refer to the NAB tutorial for simple examples of using
hooks; more advanced hooks are in Gui_hooks.ml.

<p>

<h2><a name="4">4. Packets</a></h2>

Packets are structured data types, represented using ocaml records. Compared
to a 'byte array' representation, this has the advantage of efficent
construction/deconstruction of packet fields, more concise code, and a strong
type discipline which prevents many errors.
<p>
A layer 4 packet (doc <a href="gen/L4pkt.html">here</a>) contains an application-specific payload
packet. <br>A layer 3 packet (doc <a href="gen/L3pkt.html">here</a>) contains a layer 3 header and a layer 4
packet as a payload. A layer 3 header contains at the least a source and
destination; it can also contain protocol-specific extensions. <br>Finally a layer
2 packet (doc <a href="gen/L2pkt.html">here</a>) contains a layer 2 header and a layer 3 packet as payload.


<p>

<h2><a name="5">5. Routing agents</a></h2>

A routing agent receives l4 packets from the application layer, and l2 packets
from the mac layer. The notion of 'routing' here is used in a very loose
sense: a routing agent might implement a standard unicast routing protocol, a
topology control, or any other protocol which is somewhere between the MAC and
application layers. The only requirement is that it conform to a simple
interface (doc <a href="gen/Rt_agent.t.html">here</a>). 
<p>
Users implementing a new routing agent are encouraged to inherit from the
<code>rt_agent_base</code> class (doc <a href="gen/Rt_agent_base.html">here</a>) in order to avoid dealing
with all the details of parallel stack (de-)multiplexing.

<p>


<h2><a name="6">6. MAC layers</a></h2>

A mac layer receives l3 packets from a routing agent and l2 packets from the
ether. Mac layers export certain statistics and must conform to the
<code>Mac.t</code> interface (doc <a href="gen/Mac.html">here</a>). Each MAC can also export additional
relevant statistics.
<p>
Users implementing a new routing agent are encouraged to inherit from the
<code>mac_base</code> class (doc <a href="gen/Mac_base.html">here</a>) in order to avoid dealing
with all the details of parallel stack (de-)multiplexing.
<p>
NAB currently supports a null MAC layer (doc <a href="gen/Mac_null.html">here</a>), and a contention
MAC layer (doc <a href="gen/Mac_contention.html">here</a>). A 802.11b-like MAC will be released by 
May 2004.

<p>

<h2><a name="7">7. Mobility generators</a></h2>
A mobility generator (doc <a href="gen/Mob.t.html">here</a>) is a class implementing a few simple methods
to start/stop a node, set it's speed, and provide the next position to move
to. 
<p>
A number of mobility generators (doc <a href="gen/Mobs.html">here</a>) are provided in NAB, including a
random walk, random waypoint model, billiard model, and a constrained waypoint
model (<code>epfl_waypoint</code>) which is a random waypoint constrained to
move over a graph representing the EPFL campus.

<p>

<h2><a name="8">8. Traffic generators</a></h2>
A traffic generator is a class conforming to a simple interface
(doc <a href="gen/Trafficgen.html">here</a>). There are currently two available traffic generators: a
constant bit-rate generator and a poisson generator (doc <a href="gen/Tsource.html">here</a>).
