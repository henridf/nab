<h1>Lesson 2: Investigating simple flooding dynamics</h1>
<p>
In this second lesson, we will run the same flooding protocol as lesson
1. However this time our objective is to compare flooding behavior for
different MAC layers and different MAC parameters. In so doing, we will see:
<ul>
<li> How to configure parallel protocol stacks running on each node.
<li> How to extract MAC layer statistics.
<li> How to use hooks to reconstruct high-level network states, such as the
sequence of nodes in a flood.
<li> How to use the above data to compute some statistics on flooding behavior
(namely the number of <a href="lesson2-bwlinks.html">backward links</a>)
</ul>

It is also a good idea to look at the script file 
<a href="lesson2.ml">lesson2.ml</a> which shows how one might write this up in a script.

<h2><a name="3">3. Launching the flood and viewing the statistics</a></h2>

Now that everything is set up, we can originate the flood and view the
results! <br>
For each MAC, the first line shows the total number of packets send and
received. Unsurprisingly the highest numbers are for the null mac: since there
are no collisions, every node receives the flood packet once and reforwards
it. <p>
The number of overall transmissions is reduced for contention MACS due to
collisions. The breakdown of collision types is given in the second line (for
stacks 1 and 2). Please see <a href="gen/Mac_contention.html">here</a> for a
more detailed explanation of the collision types.<p>
Finally the number of backward links is given in the third line. As expected,
we see a correlation between collisions and backward links.



<pre class=example>
# do_flood();;
# print_info();;

Stack 0 (Null MAC, 100Kbps) 

	RX: 8506 pkts. TX: 900 pkts
	27 backward links


Stack 1 (Contention MAC, 100Kbps, 0.1s jitter) 

	RX: 1973 pkts. TX: 429 pkts
	4 RX/RX colls, 216 RX/TX colls, 0 TX/TX drops, 419 TX/RX drops
	297 backward links


Stack 2 (Contention MAC, 200Kbps, 3s jitter) 

	RX: 6615 pkts. TX: 800 pkts
	4 RX/RX colls, 10 RX/TX colls, 0 TX/TX drops, 101 TX/RX drops
	133 backward links
