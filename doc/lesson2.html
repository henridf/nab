<h1>Lesson 2: Investigating simple flooding dynamics</h1>
<p>
In this second lesson, we will run the same flooding protocol as lesson
1. However this time our objective is to compare flooding behavior for
different MAC layers and different MAC parameters. In so doing, we will see:
<ul>
<li> How to configure parallel protocol stacks running on each node.
<li> How to extract MAC layer statistics.
<li> How to use hooks to reconstruct high-level network state, such as the
sequence of nodes in a flood.
<li> How to use the above data to compute some statistics on flooding behavior
(namely the number of <a href="lesson2-bwlinks.html">backward links</a>)
</ul>

It is also a good idea to look at the script file 
<a href="lesson2.ml">lesson2.ml</a> which shows how one might write this up in a script.

<h2><a name="0">0. Prerequisites</a></h2>

This lesson requires the following:
<ul>
<li> You have gone through lesson 1 in the tutorial.
</ul>

<h2><a name="1">1. Simulation setup</a></h2>
<p>

We start off by configuring the number of nodes, radio range and world size,
and creating the world object. These steps have already been done and documented in lesson 1.
<pre class=example>
# let nodes = 900;;
val nodes : int = 900
# let rrange = 12.0;;
val rrange : float = 12.
# let avg_degree = 10;;

val avg_degree : int = 10
# Param.set Params.nodes 800;;
- : unit = ()
# Param.set Params.radiorange 12.;;
  - : unit = ()
# let size = Script_utils.size ~rrange ~nodes ~avg_degree ();;
val size : float = 201.728530456155369
# Param.set Params.x_size size;;
- : unit = ()
# Param.set Params.y_size size;;
- : unit = ()
# Script_utils.init_world();;
0.000000 /global World: 201.73 x 201.73 [m],  12.00 radio range [m], 800 nodes
- : unit = ()
# let center_x = (Param.get Params.x_size) /. 2.0                  <!--test_keep-->
  and center_y = (Param.get Params.y_size) /. 2.0;;
val center_x : float = 100.864265228077684
val center_y : float = 100.864265228077684
# let nstacks = 3;;
val nstacks : int = 3
</pre>

<h2><a name="2">2. Using parallel stacks.</a></h2>
It is possible with nab to run several independent protocol stacks on each
node. Each stack is a complete entity with its own routing agent and mac
layer; each stack runs in parallel with <i>no interference</i> between
different stacks. More information on the use of stacks is in the <a
href="gen/Simplenode.simplenode.html">simplenode</a> documentation.
Note that all the logic for dealing with stacks is factored out into the base
classes for <a href="gen/Mac_base.html">mac layers</a> and <a
href="gen/Rt_agent_base.html">routing agents</a>, so protocol/mac
implementations do not have to be aware that any of this is going on. 
<p>
Stacks are identified by an <code>int</code> (stack 0, stack 1, etc). In all
functions and methods which take a stack parameter, this parameter is optional
and defaults to 0. That is why we have never had to specify a stack id in
lesson 1.
<p>
We will use 3 parallel stacks in this simulation, which each run a simple
flooding agent as in lesson 1. The difference between the stacks will come in
the MAC layer: stack 0 will run a <a href="gen/Mac_null.html">null MAC</a>, whereas stacks 1 and 2 will run
<a href="gen/Mac_contention.html">contention macs</a> with different bit rates.
This makes it straightforward to compare simple flooding behavior over
different MACs, in a situation where all other parameters are
identical. (Easy comparison of
multiple protocols or configurations is one advantage of parallel
stacks. Another is efficiency: costly computations such as node neighborhoods
are done only once, rather than once for each stack if we had to run them
sequentially).
<p>

We first create the nodes. We use the <code>make_naked_nodes</code> (which
creates nodes having neither MAC layer nor routing agent) function rather
than the <code>make_nodes</code> of lesson 1 because we will manually configure them
afterwards. <br>

<pre class=example>
# Script_utils.make_naked_nodes ();;
- : unit = ()
</pre>

In the following block we install the MAC layers as described above: null macs
on stack 0, and contention MACs on stacks 1 (with bitrate 100Kbps) and 2 (200
Kbps). We also define an array containing one description strings for each MAC
type (to be used below when printing out results).

<pre class=example>
# Script_utils.install_null_macs ~bps:1e5 ~stack:0 ();;
- : unit = ()
# Script_utils.install_contention_macs ~bps:1e5 ~stack:1 ();;
- : unit = ()
# Script_utils.install_contention_macs ~bps:2e5 ~stack:2 ();;
- : unit = ()
# let stack_descriptions = <!--test_keep-->
  [|<!--test_keep-->
    "Null MAC, 100Kbps";<!--test_keep-->
    "Contention MAC, 100Kbps, 0.1s jitter";<!--test_keep-->
    "Contention MAC, 200Kbps, 3s jitter"<!--test_keep-->
  |];;
val stack_descriptions : string array =
  [|"Null MAC, 100Kbps"; "Contention MAC, 100Kbps, 0.1s jitter";
    "Contention MAC, 200Kbps, 3s jitter"|]
</pre>


We also modify the jitter value (documented <a
href="gen/Mac_contention.contentionmac.html">here</a>) on stack 2, setting it
to 3 seconds. 
This means that MACs on stack 2 will wait for a random time (uniformly
distributed between 0 and 3 seconds) before transmitting every packet. A
higher jitter value results in lower collision probability when neighboring
nodes receive and rebroadcast a flood packet.

<pre class=example>
# Hashtbl.iter (fun nid mac -> mac#set_jitter 3.0) (Mac_contention.macs ~stack:2 ());;
- : unit = ()
</pre>

Finally we must not forget to create the flooding agents on all 3 stacks:

<pre class=example>
# for stack = 0 to nstacks - 1 do                       <!--test_keep-->
    Script_utils.make_flood_agents ~stack ()            <!--test_keep-->
  done;;
- : unit = ()
</pre>

<p>

<h2><a name="3">3. Setting up hooks and launching the flood.</a></h2>

Our nodes are now configured and ready to go. If we wish, we can now originate
flood packets at any node as in lesson 1. In fact this time we will choose the
originator to be the node closest to the center of the world:

<pre class=example>
# let originator = Opt.get ((World.w())#find_closest ~pos:(center_x, center_y) ());;
val originator : Common.nodeid_t ref = {contents = 397}
</pre>

But before so doing, we shall
install monitoring hooks to reconstruct the flood tree. Note that in lesson 1
we have already used hooks, in a very simple configuration, in order to count
the total number of packet transmissions. To do this, our hook functions
simply needed to increment a global counter each time they were called.<br>

Reconstructing a global flood tree is not as trivial as counting packets, but
we will now see that thanks to ocaml's high-level type system, it is quite
easy with <code>nab</code>. Let us first define what we mean by flood
tree. For a given network flood, a flood tree is the tree such that:
a) the root is the node which originates the flood, and b) each node has as
parent the node from which it first received the flood packet. <br>
Therefore, this corresponds to the reverse-path tree of the flood.

The hook uses the <a href="gen/NaryTree.html">n-ary tree</a> implementation
provided with nab. We will setup the hook to be called each time a packet is
received by a node. When this happens our hook tries to extend the tree
representing the flood, by adding the receiving node as the child of the node
which sent the packet. If the receiving node is already in the tree, this
means that it is receiving the packet for the second time, in which case we do
not modify the tree.

<pre class=example>
# let tree_hook flood_tree l2pkt node = (                                    <!--test_keep-->
  let l2src = (L2pkt.l2src l2pkt) in                                         <!--test_keep-->
  flood_tree := try (Flood.addnode  ~parent:l2src ~node:node#id !flood_tree) <!--test_keep-->
  with (Failure "addnode") -> !flood_tree                                    <!--test_keep-->
);;
val tree_hook : Flood.t ref -> L2pkt.t -> < id : Common.nodeid_t; .. > -> unit =  &lt;fun&gt;
</pre>

Of course we will build one distinct tree for each protocol stack. We store
the three trees (initially empty) in an array and install the hooks on the
nodes:

<pre class=example>
# let flood_trees = ref ( Array.init nstacks (fun _ -> ref (Flood.create originator)));;
val flood_trees : Flood.t ref array ref =
  {contents =
    [|{contents = NaryTree.Node (397, [])};
      {contents = NaryTree.Node (397, [])};
      {contents = NaryTree.Node (397, [])}|]}
# for stack = 0 to nstacks - 1  do                                           <!--test_keep-->
    Nodes.iter (fun n -> n#clear_pkt_mhooks ~stack ());                      <!--test_keep-->
    Nodes.iter (fun n -> n#add_pktin_mhook ~stack (tree_hook !flood_trees.(stack)));<!--test_keep-->
  done;;
- : unit = ()
</pre>


And now we are ready to originate the flood! Note that after you enter the
run() command, the toplevel might take a few seconds to complete the flood.

<pre class=example>
# (Nodes.node originator)#originate_app_pkt ~l4pkt:(`APP_PKT 0) ~dst:L3pkt.l3_bcast_addr;;
# (Sched.s())#run();;
- : unit = ()
</pre>



<h2><a name="4">4. Computing statistics.</a></h2>

Now that the flood has been done, we can ask the ocaml toplevel to give us the
text representation of the generated tree by entering the variable name at the
prompt. As you can see this is not very easy to parse visually. (But if you're
feeling adventurous, you could use the <code>draw_tree</code> primitive
in <a href="gen/Gui_ops.html">visualization</a> libraries to draw the trees in a
graphics window).

<p>
<pre class=example>
# !flood_trees.(0);;
  - : Flood.t ref =
{contents =
  NaryTree.Node (397,
   [NaryTree.Node (538, []);
    NaryTree.Node (498,
     [NaryTree.Node (560,
       [NaryTree.Node (490,
         [NaryTree.Node (489,
           [NaryTree.Node (441, []);
            NaryTree.Node (150,
             [NaryTree.Node (215,
               [NaryTree.Node (551,
                 [NaryTree.Node (517,
                   [NaryTree.Node (281, []);
                    NaryTree.Node (627,
                     [NaryTree.Node (651,
                       [NaryTree.Node (158,
                         [NaryTree.Node (149, []); NaryTree.Node (62, [])]);
                        NaryTree.Node (645, []); NaryTree.Node (694, []);
               .
               .  
               .  
        ...]);
      ...]);
    ...])}
</pre>


Ok, so inspecting our tree as above is not too helpful. However, we can
extract our statistic of interest (number of bw links) in a few lines of code:

<pre class=example>
# let dist_to_originator n =                           <!--test_keep-->
  let orig_pos = ((World.w())#nodepos originator)     <!--test_keep-->
  and n_pos = ((World.w())#nodepos n)                  <!--test_keep-->
  in  Coord.dist_sq  orig_pos n_pos;;                  <!--test_keep-->
val dist_to_originator : Common.nodeid_t -> float =  &lt;fun&gt;

# let is_backward child parent =  dist_to_originator child < dist_to_originator parent<!--test_keep-->
val is_backward : Common.nodeid_t -> Common.nodeid_t -> bool =  &lt;fun&gt;
# let count_backward_links tree =                                     <!--test_keep-->
  let ctr = ref 0 in                                                  <!--test_keep-->
  NaryTree.iter2                                                      <!--test_keep-->
    ~f:(fun ~parent  ~child -> if is_backward child parent then incr ctr)<!--test_keep-->
    tree;                                                             <!--test_keep-->
  !ctr;;                                                              <!--test_keep-->
val count_backward_links : Common.nodeid_t NaryTree.t -> int = &lt;fun&gt;
</pre>


We can now count and dump out the number of backward links for each stack. It
should not be too surprising that there are more backward links with a
contention mac, given that the contention mac can have collisions, which can
cause a node not to receive the flood packet from the first node which emits
it.


<pre class=example>
# for stack = 0 to nstacks - 1 do                                       <!--test_keep-->
    Printf.printf "Stack %d (%s) \n\n" stack stack_descriptions.(stack);<!--test_keep-->
    let backlinks = (count_backward_links !(!flood_trees.(stack))) in   <!--test_keep-->
    Printf.printf "\t%d backward links\n\n" backlinks;                  <!--test_keep-->
done;;                                                                  <!--test_keep-->

Stack 0 (Null MAC, 100Kbps) 

	42 backward links

Stack 1 (Contention MAC, 100Kbps, 0.1s jitter) 

	228 backward links

Stack 2 (Contention MAC, 200Kbps, 3s jitter) 

	160 backward links

- : unit = ()
# 
</pre>

Let's see if the MAC-layer statistics give us more insight into the backward
link figures we have just observed. <br>
First, a word on the statistics exported by MAC layers. Each MAC layer object
keeps track of packets/bits transmitted/received, and makes these available as
a record of type <a href="gen/Mac.html#TYPEbasic_stats">basic_stats</a>
through an accessor method with same name. These statistics can be see as the
"lowest common denominator" of MAC-layer stats, hence their simplicity.
<br> Then,
individual MAC types can maintain additional information which is accessible through
the virtual method <a href="gen/Mac_base.base.html">other_stats</a> of the
base MAC class. 
The <a href="gen/Mac_contention.html">contentionmac</a> MAC for example keeps
counters for the various possible types of collisions.
<p>
We now define some functions to compute the totals over all MACs' statistics:

<pre class=example>
let add_basic_stats stack = <!--test_keep-->
  Hashtbl.fold <!--test_keep-->
    (fun nodeid mac stats -> Mac_base.add_bstats mac#basic_stats stats)<!--test_keep-->
    (Mac_base.macs ~stack ())<!--test_keep-->
    (Mac_base.zero_bstats())<!--test_keep-->
;;
val add_basic_stats : int -> Mac.basic_stats =  &lt;fun&gt;

# let add_cont_stats stack = <!--test_keep-->
  Hashtbl.fold <!--test_keep-->
    (fun nodeid mac stats -> Contention_frontend.add_ostats mac#other_stats stats)<!--test_keep-->
    (Mac_contention.macs ~stack ())<!--test_keep-->
    (Contention_frontend.zero_ostats());;
val add_cont_stats : int -> Contention_frontend.stats =  &lt;fun&gt;
# 
</pre>

If you are new to ocaml and the notion of "folding" (as in
<code>Hashtbl.fold</code> above) a data structure is not familiar, you should
probably spend a little time gaining familiarity with by looking at the
various fold_* functions in the ocaml standard library
(Array.fold_left/fold_right, List.fold_left/fold_right, etc). Folding is a
very powerful and general means of computing some result over a data structure
containing multiple values.

For example, consider the function below, which does exactly the same thing as
<code>add_basic_stats</code> above, but in a more "c-like" way (ie with a for
loop instead of a fold). Less concise and much less readable!

<pre class=example>
# let add_basic_stats_imperative stack = <!--test_keep-->
  let totals = ref (Mac_base.zero_bstats()) in<!--test_keep-->
  let macs = (Mac_base.macs ~stack ()) in<!--test_keep-->
  for nodeid = 0 to Param.get Params.nodes - 1 do<!--test_keep-->
    let mac = Hashtbl.find macs nodeid <!--test_keep-->
    in totals := Mac_base.add_bstats !totals mac#basic_stats<!--test_keep-->
  done;<!--test_keep-->
  !totals;;
val add_basic_stats_imperative : int -> Mac.basic_stats =  &lt;fun&gt;
</pre>

With this, we can dump out the aggregate stats over all mac layers and all stacks:

<pre class=example>
# for stack = 0 to nstacks - 1 do <!--test_keep-->
    Printf.printf "Stack %d (%s) \n\n" stack stack_descriptions.(stack);<!--test_keep-->
    let totals = add_basic_stats stack in<!--test_keep-->
    Printf.printf "\t%s\n" (Mac_base.string_of_bstats_pkts totals);<!--test_keep-->

    if stack <> 0 then ( (* null mac doesn't have additional stats *)<!--test_keep-->
      let totals = add_cont_stats stack in<!--test_keep-->
      Printf.printf "\t%s\n" (Contention_frontend.string_of_ostats totals);<!--test_keep-->
    );<!--test_keep-->
    print_newline();<!--test_keep-->
  done;;

Stack 0 (Null MAC, 100Kbps) 

	RX: 6707 pkts. TX: 801 pkts

Stack 1 (Contention MAC, 100Kbps, 0.1s jitter) 

	RX: 1656 pkts. TX: 373 pkts
	4 RX/RX colls, 186 RX/TX colls, 0 TX/TX drops, 359 TX/RX drops

Stack 2 (Contention MAC, 200Kbps, 3s jitter) 

	RX: 5524 pkts. TX: 725 pkts
	2 RX/RX colls, 9 RX/TX colls, 0 TX/TX drops, 76 TX/RX drops

- : unit = ()
# 
</pre>
For each MAC, the first line shows the total number of packets sent and
received. Not surprisingly the highest numbers are for the null mac: since there
are no collisions, every node receives the flood packet once and reforwards
it. 
The number of overall transmissions is reduced for contention MACS due to
collisions. The breakdown of collision types is given in the second line (for
stacks 1 and 2). Not surprisingly, stack 1 has more collisions than stack 2:
since it has a both lower bit rate and lower jitter, packet transmission last
lower and are less spread out in time.
Please see <a href="gen/Mac_contention.html">here</a> for a
more detailed explanation of the collision types.<p>
