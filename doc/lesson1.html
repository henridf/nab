This lesson requires the following:
<ul>
<li> You have installed the Objective Caml distribution (see <a
href="../README">README</a> from mws distribution)
</ul>
It is recommended that:
<ul>
<li> You have built the source documentation by typing <code>make
htmldoc</code>(see <a href="../README">README</a>). If you haven't, things
will run fine, but some of the links to source documentation will not work.
<li> You have gained basic familiarity with ocaml.
</ul>

You launch the mws toplevel by simply typing bin/mws-top at the prompt:
<pre>
[henridf@lilblue: ~/work/mws] bin/mws-top 

   Multihop Wireless Simulator (mws) version 0.1
          Objective Caml version 3.07+2

# 
</pre>


Now, you have the mws command-line - similar in all aspects to the ocaml
toplevel, except that all mws libraries and functionality are
linked in.<br>
Before calling mws functions, we must inform the toplevel about a few paths where source and compiled
files are to be found. This can be done manually, using the #directory
command:
<br>

<pre>
# #directory "/home/henridf/work/mws/lib";;
</pre>


Since there are several directories to add to the path, it is simpler to 
place these in a .ocamlinit file (which should go in your homedir). See 
the included <a href="ocamlinit">.ocamlinit</a> for an example.
Once you have your .ocamlinit file edited and
in the right place, you should exit (<code>exit 0;;</code>
) and restart the caml toplevel, or type 
<pre>
# #use /path/to/homedir/.ocamlinit;;
</pre>
 to reload the .ocamlinit file without restarting.

<font  size="-1">
<b>Note:</b> You will quickly notice that the ocaml toplevel does not have the
ability to navigate previous commands, or other textual navigation. It is
intended to be used the toplevel in conjunction with an emacs mode such as tuareg
or the caml emacs mode; alternatively you may use the ocamlbrowser tool included in the ocaml distribution. (xxx pointers)

      2. Configuring basic simulation parameters

Let's start by configuring a few basic parameters such as the number of nodes
in the simulation, the MAC layer involved, etc. In mws, these key parameters
are represented using Param values. Param offers a simple interface to get/set
values, as well as helpful functionality to such as defaults, range checking,
or parsing these values as command-line arguments to mws. <br>

Let's first set the number of nodes. First we might want to see what the
default number is:<br>

<pre>
# Param.get Params.nodes;;
- : int = 500
</pre>

Maybe we would like more nodes, say 800:

<pre>
# Param.set Params.nodes 800;;
- : unit = ()
</pre>

<font  size="-1">
<b>Note:</b> If you've compiled the documentation (see README), the Param API can be
viewed <a href="gen/Param.html">here</a>
</font><p>

Now, let's move on and configure some other basic parameters.
We'll say the nodes' radio range is 12 meters:<br>

<pre>
# Param.set Params.rrange 12.;;
- : unit = ()
</pre>

Ok, so we have 800 nodes with a 12 meter radio range. What size area should we
set? Assume that nodes will be uniformly distributed, and that we want an
average node degree of 7, and that our area is square, then we should have a
world of size (800  * pi * 12^2) / 7.<br>
Since we are lazy, we can use a built-in helper function to compute this for
us:

<pre>
# let size = Script_utils.size ~rrange:12.0 ~nodes:800 ~avg_degree:8 ();;
val size : float = 212.640541760032193
</pre>

<Font  Size="-1">
<b>Note:</b> : The file scripts/script_utils.ml
(doc <a href="gen/Script_utils.html">here</a>) contains many useful
helper functions designed to be used in the toplevel or from scripts. Take a
look there, you may find that what you need is already implemented. And if you
write other helpers, please consider contributing them back so they make their
way into the next release!
</font><br><p>

<pre>
# Param.set Params.x_size size;;
- : unit = ()
# Param.set Params.y_size size;;
- : unit = ()
</pre>


We now instantiate the global world object - this is where all operations requiring
global network knowledge (computing neighborhoods, etc) are done. The world
object must be instantiated *after* the proper values for rrange and world
size have been set. 

<pre>
# Script_utils.init_lazy_world();;
0.000000 /global World: size (212.64, 212.64), rrange 12.0,  800 nodes
- : unit = ()
</pre>


To instantiate our nodes (which will be uniformly dispersed in the area), we do:

<pre>
# Script_utils.make_nodes ();;
 - : unit = ()
</pre>

We choose to use a null mac layer - this is a 'perfect' mac where all packets
sent by a node within radio range are received, with no collisions or loss.
<Font  Size="-1">
<B>Note:</B> : for an overview of other MAC layers available, see
<a href="gen/Mac.html">here</a>
</font><br>

<pre>
# Param.set Params.mac "nullmac";;
- : unit = ()
</pre>

Now, the last thing we need to do before we get packets flowing is to choose
some sort of routing agent.

      3. Running a simple flooding protocol.

Let's go with a very simple flooding agent. All
this one does is to receive packets and reforward a packet it receives for the
first time.

<pre>
# Script_utils.make_flood_agents();;
- : unit = ()
</pre>

Ok! Let's pick a node in the middle of the area to flood from:

<pre>
# let originator = Opt.get 
    ((World.w())#find_closest ~pos:(size /. 2.0, size /. 2.0) ());;
  val originator : Common.nodeid_t = 397
</pre>

Now we inject a packet to flood at that node :
<pre>
# (Nodes.node originator)#originate_app_pkt ~dst:L3pkt.l3_bcast_addr;;
- : unit = ()
</pre>

At this point, the flooding has not happened, because the simulation is not
running. To make the simulation run, we need to start the event loop:

<pre>
# (Sched.s())#run();;
- : unit = ()
</pre>

[This call simply tells the event loop to run until there are no more events
to process. One can also run for a fixed amount of simulated seconds, or run
untils a condition is met, etc. To see the scheduler interface, see
(<a href="gen/Scheduler.t.html">here</a>)

So, we've run the simulator, the flood has happened, but there's not much to
see at this point. We can see that a little time has elapsed, knowing that the
simulator clock always starts at 0.0:

<pre>
# Time.time();;
- : Time.time_t = 0.0295895411164387376
</pre>

If we want a bit more verbosity, we can change the log level to INFO or even DEBUG.
Now if we start another flood, we will get LOTS of output (press C-c C-c to
interrupt)!

Let's set the log level back to INFO for now:

Now, let's say we wanted to compute a very simple statistic on this flood: the
total number of packets transmitted. To do this, we will use 'hooks', which
is mechanism in mws to extract packet-level information as a simulation runs. A
hook is simply a variable holding one or more function(s) to be called at a
specific occasion (this customization mechanism will be familiar to emacs
users). The type of 'occasion' where one would like the hook to call a
function is related to packet events, ie a node receives or transmits a
packet.

Let's define a counter and create a function that increments it each time it
is called:

<pre>
# let pkt_count = ref 0;;
val pkt_count : int ref = {contents = 0}
# let hook pkt node = incr pkt_count;;
val hook : 'a -> 'b -> unit = <fun>
</pre>

Then we add our hook to every node:

<pre>
# Nodes.iter (fun n -> n#add_pktout_mhook hook);;
- : unit = ()
</pre>

<pre>
# (Nodes.node originator)#originate_app_pkt ~dst:L3pkt.l3_bcast_addr;;
0.0.092467 /node/397/Flood_Agent Received packet from upper-layer packet for broadcast
# (Sched.s())#run();;
- : unit = ()
</pre>

And we can see how many packets have been transmitted:

<pre>
# !pkt_count;;
- : int = 1601
</pre>

Note that this example represents the most basic use of hooks. Our hook in
fact does not do anything with the two parameters it is passed, which are the
packet being sent and the node transmitting the packet. <br>
Hooks are a very powerful and generic mechanism to extract just about any
information from ongoing protocol interactions, without having to put any
explicit support in the protocol code itself. For example, hooks can be used
to record the sequence of hops in a route. To do this, our hook would simply
add the next hop to a global data structure, and maybe set a boolean to true
when the packet arrives at the destination, so that the scheduler check this
and stop processing events once the route is established. <br>
Or, we could have a hook to keep per-node statistics on the number of bytes
transmitted, or the number of packets of a particular type transmitted. And
all of this can be done without messing about with the protocol internals -
which is much cleaner and more modular than if we had to hack each routing
protocol with our statistics gathering functions.
