<h2><a name="1">0. Prerequisites</a></h2>

This lesson requires the following:
<ul>
<li> You have installed the Objective Caml distribution (see <a
href="../README">README</a> from <code>NAB</code> distribution)
<li> You have built the <code>NAB-top</code> interactive toplevel (see <a
href="../README">README</a> from <code>NAB</code> distribution)
</ul>
It is recommended that:
<ul>
<li> You have built the source documentation by typing <code>make
htmldoc </code>(see <a href="../README">README</a>). If you haven't, things
will run fine, but some of the links to source documentation will not work.
<li> You have gained basic familiarity with ocaml.
</ul>

      
<h2><a name="1">1. Launching and setting up the <code>NAB</code> toplevel</a></h2>


You launch the <code>NAB</code> toplevel by simply typing bin/fake-top at the prompt:
<pre class=example>
[henridf@lilblue: ~/work/NAB] bin/fake-top 

   Multihop Wireless Simulator (NAB) version 0.1
          Objective Caml version 3.07+2

# 
</pre>


Now, you have the <code>NAB</code> command-line - similar in all aspects to the ocaml
toplevel, except that all <code>NAB</code> libraries and functionality are
linked in.<br>
Before calling API functions exported by <code>NAB</code>, we must inform the
toplevel about a few paths where source and compiled
files are to be found. This can be done manually, using the #directory
command:
<br>

<pre class=example>
# #directory "/home/henridf/work/NAB/lib";;
</pre>


Since there are several directories to add to the path, it is simpler to 
place these in a .ocamlinit file (which should go in your homedir). See 
the included <a href="ocamlinit">.ocamlinit</a> for an example.
Once you have your .ocamlinit file edited and
in the right place, you should exit (<code>exit 0;;</code>
) and restart the caml toplevel, or type 
<pre class=example>
# #use "/path/to/homedir/.ocamlinit";;
</pre>
 to reload the .ocamlinit file without restarting.

</font><br>


<font  size="-1">
<b>Note:</b> You will quickly notice that the ocaml toplevel does not have the
ability to navigate previous commands, or other textual navigation. It is
intended to be used in conjunction with an emacs mode such as the one provided
with the ocaml distribution, or <a href="http://www-rocq.inria.fr/~acohen/tuareg/">tuareg</a>;
alternatively you may use the <code>ocamlbrowser</code> tool which is 
included in the ocaml distribution (see <a
href="http://caml.inria.fr/oreilly-book/html/book-ora213.html">here</a> for an
overview or <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/htmlman/manual028.html">here
for more info</a>).

<h2><a name="2">2. Configuring basic simulation parameters</a></h2>



Let's start by configuring a few basic parameters such as the number of nodes
in the simulation, the MAC layer involved, etc. In <code>NAB</code>, these key parameters
are represented using Param values. Param offers a simple interface to get/set
values, as well as helpful functionality to such as defaults, range checking,
or parsing these values as command-line arguments to <code>NAB</code>. <br>

Let's first set the number of nodes. First we might want to see what the
default number is:<br>

<pre class=example>
# Param.get Params.nodes;;
- : int = 500
</pre>

Maybe we would like more nodes, say 800:

<pre class=example>
# Param.set Params.nodes 800;;
- : unit = ()
</pre>

<font  size="-1">
<b>Note:</b> If you've compiled the documentation (see README), the Param API can be
viewed <a href="gen/Param.html">here</a>
</font><p>

Now, let's move on and configure some other basic parameters.
We'll say the nodes' radio range is 12 meters:<br>

<pre class=example>
# Param.set Params.rrange 12.;;
- : unit = ()
</pre>

Ok, so we have 800 nodes with a 12 meter radio range. What size area should we
set? Assume that nodes will be uniformly distributed, and that we want an
average node degree of 7, and that our area is square, then we should have a
world of size (800  * pi * 12^2) / 7.<br>
Since we are lazy, we can use a built-in helper function to compute this for
us:

<pre class=example>
# let size = Script_utils.size ~rrange:12.0 ~nodes:800 ~avg_degree:8 ();;
val size : float = 212.640541760032193
</pre>


<b>Note:</b> <Font  Size="-1"><i>The file scripts/script_utils.ml
(doc <a href="gen/Script_utils.html">here</a>) contains many useful
helper functions designed to be used in the toplevel or from scripts. Take a
look there, you may find that what you need is already implemented. And if you
write other helpers, please consider contributing them back so they make their
way into the next release!</i>
</font><br><p>

<pre class=example>
# Param.set Params.x_size size;;
- : unit = ()
# Param.set Params.y_size size;;
- : unit = ()
</pre>


We now instantiate the global world object - this is where all operations requiring
global network knowledge (computing neighborhoods, etc) are done. The world
object must be instantiated *after* the proper values for rrange and world
size have been set. 

<pre class=example>
# Script_utils.init_lazy_world();;
0.000000 /global World: size (212.64, 212.64), rrange 12.0,  800 nodes
- : unit = ()
</pre>


We choose to use a null mac layer - this is a 'perfect' mac where all packets
sent by a node within radio range are received, with no collisions or loss.
<Font  Size="-1">
<B>Note:</B> : for an overview of other MAC layers available, see
<a href="gen/Mac.html">here</a>
</font><br>

<pre class=example>
# Param.set Params.mac "nullmac";;
- : unit = ()
</pre>

To instantiate our nodes (which will be uniformly dispersed in the area), we do:

<pre class=example>
# Script_utils.make_nodes ();;
 - : unit = ()
</pre>

Now, the last thing we need to do before we get packets flowing is to choose
some sort of routing agent. 

<p>
<h2><a name="3">3. Running a simple flooding protocol.</a></h2>

Let's go with a very simple flooding agent. All
this one does is to receive packets and reforward a packet it receives for the
first time.

<pre class=example>
# Script_utils.make_flood_agents();;
- : unit = ()
</pre>

Ok! Let's pick a node in the middle of the area to flood from:

<pre class=example>
# let originator = Opt.get 
    ((World.w())#find_closest ~pos:(size /. 2.0, size /. 2.0) ());;
  val originator : Common.nodeid_t = 397
</pre>

Now we inject a packet to flood at that node :
<pre class=example>
# (Nodes.node originator)#originate_app_pkt ~dst:L3pkt.l3_bcast_addr;;
- : unit = ()
</pre>

At this point, the flooding has not happened, because the simulation is not
running. To make the simulation run, we need to start the event loop:

<pre class=example>
# (Sched.s())#run();;
- : unit = ()
</pre>

[This call simply tells the event loop to run until there are no more events
to process. One can also run for a fixed amount of simulated seconds, or run
untils a condition is met, etc. To see the scheduler interface, see
(<a href="gen/Scheduler.t.html">here</a>)

So, we've run the simulator, the flood has happened, but there's not much to
see at this point. We can see that a little time has elapsed, knowing that the
simulator clock always starts at 0.0:

<pre class=example>
# Time.time();;
- : Time.time_t = 0.0295895411164387376
</pre>

If we want a bit more verbosity, we can change the log level to INFO or even DEBUG.
Now if we start another flood, we will get LOTS of output (press C-c C-c to
interrupt)!

<pre class=example>
# Log.set_log_level Log.LOG_DEBUG;;
- : unit = ()
# (Nodes.node originator)#originate_app_pkt ~dst:L3pkt.l3_bcast_addr;;

Let's set the log level back to INFO for now:

<pre class=example>
# Log.set_log_level Log.LOG_INFO;;
- : unit = ()
</pre>

<p>

<h2><a name="4"> 4. Using hooks to record packet statistics</a></h2>
Now, let's say we wanted to compute a very simple statistic on this flood: the
total number of packets transmitted. To do this, we will use 'hooks', which
is mechanism in <code>NAB</code> to extract packet-level information as a simulation runs. A
hook is simply a variable holding one or more function(s) to be called at a
specific occasion (this customization mechanism will be familiar to emacs
users). The type of 'occasion' where one would like the hook to call a
function is related to packet events, ie a node receives or transmits a
packet.

Let's define a counter and create a function that increments it each time it
is called:

<pre class=example>
# let pkt_count = ref 0;;
val pkt_count : int ref = {contents = 0}
# let hook pkt node = incr pkt_count;;
val hook : 'a -> 'b -> unit = <fun>
</pre>

Then we add our hook to every node:

<pre class=example>
# Nodes.iter (fun n -> n#add_pktout_mhook hook);;
- : unit = ()
</pre>

<pre class=example>
# (Nodes.node originator)#originate_app_pkt ~dst:L3pkt.l3_bcast_addr;;
0.0.092467 /node/397/Flood_Agent Received packet from upper-layer packet for broadcast
# (Sched.s())#run();;
- : unit = ()
</pre>

And we can see how many packets have been transmitted:

<pre class=example>
# !pkt_count;;
- : int = 1601
</pre>

Note that this example represents the most basic use of hooks. Our hook in
fact does not do anything with the two parameters it is passed, which are the
packet being sent and the node transmitting the packet. <br>
Hooks are a very powerful and generic mechanism to extract just about any
information from ongoing protocol interactions, without having to put any
explicit support in the protocol code itself. For example, hooks can be used
to record the sequence of hops in a route. To do this, our hook would simply
add the next hop to a global data structure, and maybe set a boolean to true
when the packet arrives at the destination, so that the scheduler check this
and stop processing events once the route is established. <br>
Or, we could have a hook to keep per-node statistics on the number of bytes
transmitted, or the number of packets of a particular type transmitted. And
all of this can be done without messing about with the protocol internals -
which is much cleaner and more modular than if we had to hack each routing
protocol with our statistics gathering functions.
