<h1>Backward links in wireless flooding</h1>

Many protocols in ad hoc and sensor networks make use of an underlying
flooding primitive. For example a routing protocol might use flooding to disseminate a route
request, or a data gathering protocol in a sensor network might use flooding
to disseminate interest in a particular piece of information.<br>
In the simplest form of flooding, a node rebroadcasts a flood packet which it
receives for the first time, and quenches duplicates.
<p>
In an ideal model of wireless connectivity and propagation, the flood moves
<i>away</i> from the destination, meaning that each successive node which
receives a flood packet is further than the previous ones. But in practice
(see reference below), it will often happen that there are <i>backward
links</i>, in which the recipient of the flood packet is closer to the
originator than the transmitter.
