<h1>Programming in Ocaml</h1>

<a href="http://caml.inria.fr">Ocaml</a> is a high-level, yet highly efficient
programming language which supports both object-oriented and functional
programming styles. Ocaml has a number of attributes which make it very
well-suited to writing a network simulator: 
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.bagley.org/~doug/shootout/craps.shtml">Speed, speed, speed.</a>.
<li>An interactive toplevel, which natively gives the advantages of a
scripting language (interactively develop scripts, examine simulator
state). This makes things <b>much</b> simpler than integrating a scripting
language into a non-scripted language (say c++ and otcl), since everything
remains in one language, with no bindings to write, etc.
<li>A replay debugger.
<li>Support for high-level, structured data types. For example a data type representing
an AODV route discovery (sequence of hops + possible route repair
floods) can be defined in a few lines.
</ul>





<h4>Documentation</h4>
We recommend having at least basic familiarity with <a
href="http://caml.inria.fr">ocaml</a> (or another ML-derived language) prior
to starting out in <code>nab</code>. There are many great
resources 
(<a href="http://caml.inria.fr/books-eng.html">Books</a> and <a
href="http://caml.inria.fr/tutorials-eng.html">Tutorials</a>)
available to learn ocaml; two excellent ones in
particular are:

<ul>
  <li> The 'Oreilly book' (online in <a
href="http://caml.inria.fr/oreilly-book/">English</a> or in <a
href="http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/Livres/ora/DA-OCAML/index.html">French</a>) is
an well-written and well-structured book, with both introductory and advanced
material. (a good read through chapters 2, 3, and 4 should be sufficient to
get started in <code>nab</code>). 

  <li> A more practical approach is in R. Jones' <a
href="http://www.merjis.com/developers/ocaml_tutorial/">tutorial</a>, 
which teaches ocaml by comparing and contrasting it with c and java. 
</ul>

<h4>Community</h4>

A lot of valuable information can be obtained through the ocaml mailing
lists. <p>
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ocaml_beginners/">ocaml_beginners</a>
is a great place to ask questions when starting out, and the <a
href="http://caml.inria.fr/caml-list-eng.html">caml-list</a> is also a
valuable resource for less trivial problems.
